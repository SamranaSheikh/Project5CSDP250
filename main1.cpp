/*Program Description :
*This C++ program implements a Binary Search Tree(BST) with a lot of operations such as deletion, tree traversal, insertion,
* and checking if the tree is an AVL tree or if it is not. The program shows
* the usage of the BinarySearchTree class through a main program,
* allowing users to interact with the tree data structure.
